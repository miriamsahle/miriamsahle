# Hi there! 👋 I'm Miriam Sahle

I’m a Fullstack Web Developer student based in Stockholm, Sweden, with a growing passion for **UX/UI design** and frontend development. 

## 💻 What I’m Learning
At school, I'm getting hands-on experience with:
- **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS
- **Frameworks:** React.js, Next.js
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, SQL, MongoDB, API integrations, and CMS systems

But my true interest lies in **UX/UI design**! I recently completed a project using **Figma**, and I was blown away by how much fun it was to bring ideas to life through design. I’m eager to dive deeper into frontend development, blending creativity and code to create exceptional user experiences.

## 🔭 What I’m Working On
- 🌟 Learning more about UX/UI design principles and how to apply them to real-world projects.
- ⚛️ Building frontend applications with React.js to improve both my development and design skills.
- 🎨 Experimenting with Figma to turn concepts into interactive, user-focused designs.

## 🐾 Meet Kuro
When I’m not coding or designing, you can find me hanging out with my adorable pug, Kuro! He’s 2 years old, full of personality, and you might recognize him from my GitHub profile pic. 🐶
